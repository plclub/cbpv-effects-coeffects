# CBPV with Resource Tracking
This repository contains a mechanized semantic soundness proof of a CBPV system extended with a resource usage coeffect, as well as proofs of type-and-resource-usage preservation of translations from CBN and CBV.

## CBPV: Definitions and soundness
The CBPV folder contains definitions and soundness proofs for the resource tracking CBPV system.
[CBPV/syntax.sig](CBPV/syntax.sig) : CBPV syntax specification in the form of HOAS

[CBPV/syntax.v](CBPV/syntax.v) : Syntax file generated by Autosubst 2 from [CBPV/syntax.sig](CBPV/syntax.sig).
    Because Autosubst does not generate the imports for this file, the [Makefile](Makefile) adds these using
    [add_imports_to_syntax.pl](add_imports_to_syntax.pl).
    *Do not edit this file directly*

[CBPV/typing.v](CBPV/typing.v) : Syntactic typing rules

[CBPV/semantics.v](CBPV/semantics.v) : Instrumented big-step environment-based operational semantics

[CBPV/semtyping.v](CBPV/semtyping.v) : Semantic typing rules

[CBPV/soundness.v](CBPV/soundness.v) : Fundamental lemma of the logical relation and type-and-resource-usage soundness. The bulk of the proof can be found in [CBPV/semtyping.v](CBPV/semtyping.v)


## Translations

### CBPV
